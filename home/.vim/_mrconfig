#       DUNNO/2022-10-23: That the `skip` I referred to above that I don't use?

# SAVVY/2024-02-18: These files won't exist until you run `infuse`
# for the first time, because they're symlinked from ~/.depoxy/home/.vim

# USAGE: Optional private DepoXy Client Vim projects.
# - To use, create an OMR config in your DepoXy Client, at
#     ${DEPOXYDIR_STINTS_FULL}/${DEPOXY_CLIENT_ID}/home/.vim/_mrconfig-private
#   E.g., ~/.depoxy/stints/1234/home/.vim/_mrconfig-private
#   And then `infuse` to wire it (see `seed_myrepos_mrconfig_dubs_vim`
#   in ~/.depoxy/ambers/home/infuse-dubs-vim).
# - Alternatively, you can instead create a private config under DepoXy:
#     ${DEPOXYDIR_BASE_FULL:-${HOME}/.depoxy}/ambers/home/.vim/_mrconfig-private

# SAVVY: End with a [DEFAULT] section because previous cat'ted file ends
#        with a [/path/to/project] section. If not, the file the cats
#        this file would have to specify [DEFAULT] again to avoid config
#        after the cat from going to [/path/to/project].
