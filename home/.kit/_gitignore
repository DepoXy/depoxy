# *** root

# Git requires hard-links, so if this breaks and you edited
# the installed file:
#   meld ~/.depoxy/ambers/home/.kit/_gitignore ~/.kit/.gitignore &
/.gitignore

# *** JavaScript

# LATER/2021-01-28: WIP: This coverage diff tool looks awesome.
# - But I either new admin access to the project to wire it as an action;
# - Or, I need to figure out if I can run it locally.

# Basic JS dev support: Better ctags.
# - Which is great, until you learn about Language Servers.

# - Except the language engine is embedded in the project, and
