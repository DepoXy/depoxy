# 2021-08-06: This project opened a whole can o' worms. Or at least a trifecta:
# 1.) Homebrew no longer supports `gocryptfs` because it switched from `osxfuse` to
# closed-source MacFuse, but also `brew update` fails because of its refusal, which
# meant I couldn't update my other brews (or taps, or whatever they're called). This
# led me to uninstalling `gocryptfs` to try the one from MacPorts, which seemed to
# work at first (I could an encfs to mount). But I quickly found out that no apps
# could get the current working directory from within its mounted paths, meaning it
# wasn't working. And I couldn't find a solution (or even others having the same
# problem) onlne, so then I had to uninstall it (though now that I write this,
# perhaps it was because my encfs was created with version 1, and MacPorts installed
# version 2, and projects are not backwards-compatible? who knows). So this led to an
# hour or more figuring out how to install the *old* version with Homebrew (and Home-
# brew makes it real tough; fortunately I found an article/walk-through, and was able
# to guess at a few missing steps). Finally, I learned how to pin the old version so
# that brew-update wouldn't complain about it and fail, like it was doing originally.
# 2.) I hadn't updated Homebrew projects in a while, because I don't run the update
# command regularly, nor do I run brew-install very often, which also updates all
# installed brews as a side effect. And when I updated all my Homebrew apps, the
# latest Git was installed, which no longer supports symlinked `.gitignore` files.
# So I had to add an OMR hard link helper, and I update the mrconfig infuse tasks
# to use hard links instead.
# 3.) (Now I've spent too much time griping about the first 2 items, I forgot what
# the third is. Whatever, I'm already and TMI.)
