# The Vimprojects template is only updated when synced (against DepoXy
# Client file, DXC/home/.vimprojects--purged).
# - Here we keep it from searches so you're not tempted to waste time
#   editing it otherwise.
# - What's canon is DXC/home/.vimprojects â€” go edit that, then sync
#   the --purged copy you have @home against the template.
