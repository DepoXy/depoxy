# The Vimprojects template is only updated when synced (against DepoXy
# Client file, DXC/home/.vimprojects--purged).
# - Here we keep it from searches so you're not tempted to waste time
#   editing it otherwise.
# - What's canon is DXC/home/.vimprojects — go edit that, then sync
#   the --purged copy you have @home against the template.
home/.vimprojects.EVAL

# Convenience symlink -> "Application Support" so we can use
# Vim `gf` command on paths thereunder, e.g.,
#   ~/.depoxy/ambers/archetype/home/Library/Application_Support/dob/dob.EVAL.conf
