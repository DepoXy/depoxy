# These rules are mostly used to avoid duplicate grep results
# (as opposed to ignoring content we don't care about, like
#  third-party code).

# The paths below are seen from the perspective of ~/.projlns/dubs-fries

# The ~/.projlns is a collections of symlinks to various projects and
# directories, to enable searching across projects and paths. But within
# this amalgamation, you'll find multiple paths to the same files,
# because symlinks. Many of those paths already have ignore rules in
# .ignore files managed by the projects themselves, but not all.
#
# Herein we mostly add rules to ignore duplicate paths to the same file.
