# These rules are mostly used to avoid duplicate grep results
# (as opposed to ignoring content we don't care about, like
#  third-party code).

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# As seen from the perspective of ~/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks

# The ~/.projlns is a collections of symlinks to various projects and
# directories, to enable searching across projects and paths. But within
# this amalgamation, you'll find multiple paths to the same files,
# because symlinks. Many of those paths already have ignore rules in
# .ignore files managed by the projects themselves, but not all.
#
# Aka, ignore these symlinked files to avoid duplicate grep results.

# SAVVY: The user home prefix used below — /Users/user — matches
# the default specified by the depoxyrc:
#
#   export LINK_DEEP_SUB_HOME="/Users/user"
#
# From: ~/.depoxy/running/home/.config/depoxy/depoxyrc
#
# Which is used by `mr -d / infuseProjlns`
# to populate ~/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks
#
# - INERT: Should a user choose a different path, it breaks this
#   .ignore (or at least none of the rules below will match).
#   - One option is for user to install their own .ignore deeper
#     in the path.
#   - Another option would be to move this .ignore from DXY to DXA
#     and to store in the DepoXy Client.
#     - But author has zero motivation for that.

# Note that this ignore file (*this file*):
