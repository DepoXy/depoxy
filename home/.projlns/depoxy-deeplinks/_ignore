# These rules are mostly used to avoid duplicate grep results
# (as opposed to ignoring content we don't care about, like
#  third-party code).

# As seen from the perspective of ~/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks

# The ~/.projlns is a collections of symlinks to various projects and
# directories, to enable searching across projects and paths. But within
# this amalgamation, you'll find multiple paths to the same files,
# because symlinks. Many of those paths already have ignore rules in
# .ignore files managed by the projects themselves, but not all.
#
# Aka, ignore these symlinked files to avoid duplicate grep results.

# Note that this ignore file (*this file*):
#   ~/.depoxy/ambers/home/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks/_ignore
# Appears twice under ~/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks:
#   ~/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks/.ignore
#   ~/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks/.depoxy-ambers/home/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks/_ignore
/.ignore

# DepoXy Client docs are stored under {client}/docs and wired to search
# at #13, to keep separate from (a) code and (b) open-source projects.
# - As this ignore file is for tailoring search at #9, ignore Docs.
