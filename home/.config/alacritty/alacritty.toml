# SAVVY/2024-07-10: Use an older-Linux-friendly `TERM`.
# - Alacritty defaults to its own TERM value:
#     TERM = "alacritty"
#   - But this breaks older Linux Mint (circa 2019, but latest
#     Linux Mint circa 2024 doesn't care).
#     - E.g., `less` works, but gripes:
#         @old-linux $ less README.rst
#         WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
#         README.rst  (press RETURN)
#     - Meanwhile, `tig` won't even run:
#         @old-linux $ tig
#         Error opening terminal: alacritty.
#     Which I'd bet is because it uses an old ncurses.
# - REFER: The TERM value is really just a suggestion to some
#   apps to help them display output correctly. (Which makes
#   it weird that it outright breaks some apps, but whatever.)
#   - See `man ncurses`, `man 5 terminfo`, maybe also this article:
#     https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/528323/what-uses-the-term-variable
# - SOLNS: There are easy ways around this:
#   - You could set the TERM when connecting to an old host:
#       $ TERM=xterm-256color ssh old-linux
#   - You could set the TERM when running an app that cares:
#       $ TERM=xterm-256color tig
#   - Or we could just set the TERM here, and forget about it.
#     - The author doesn't know of any app that behaves specially
#       when it sees 'TERM=alacritty', so we'll just make the
#       blanket change here.
#     - Note that different values will work for us, including:
#         TERM = "screen-256color"
#       But we'll pick the TERM value that iTerm uses:
#         TERM = "xterm-256color"
# - SAVVY: You must restart Alacritty for this setting to take
#   effect (it's one of the few that are not hot-reloaded).

  # It's too easy to Quit accidentally, especially for such a simple,
  # single-modifier keybinding (the author has at least once
  # sloppy-fingered <Cmd-q> unintentionally).
  # - Also, when you have multiple windows open, it can be very annoying.
  # - SAVVY: You cannot block <Cmd-q> solely from here. It's a Menu item,
  #   so you gotta change its macOS binding, either from System Settings,
  #   or you can change it from the CLI, e.g., remap it to <Shift-Ctrl-Q>:
  #       defaults write org.alacritty NSUserKeyEquivalents '{
  #         "Quit alacritty" = "^$q";
  #       }'
  #   - Because we gotta change NSUserKeyEquivalents anyway, we won't
  #     add the new mapping here, but we'll just rely on the menu item.

  # Remap <Shift-Ctrl-C/V> to Copy/Paste, which is how Linux mate-terminal
  # has done it, and how the author's brain is wired.

  #   - Except if you disable these while Alacritty is running, save,
  #     then re-enable them and save again, <Cmd-c>/<Cmd-v> then also
