# Only difference should be 'bind main...' vs. 'bind diff', so commands
# don't apply to other views (pager, reflog, refs, stage, stash, status),
# because tig config doesn't support reusing code for multiple commands
# (alternating, we could immediately shell-out, but I'd rather not).
#
# In many case, using 'generic' is fine, if the binding doesn't shadow
# other view bindings. But there are a few symbols defined only for the
# special views, e.g., the ! binding is defined separately for multiple
# views (reflogs, refs, stage, status).

# YOU: Add DepoXy-specific commands here.
# - The DepoXy 'main' and 'diff' files mimic the convention used
#   in tig-newtons:
#     ~/.kit/git/tig-newtons/tig/config-diff-main
#     ~/.kit/git/tig-newtons/tig/config-diff-diff
# - You might not really need this file, if you can promote
#   commands to tig-newtons.
