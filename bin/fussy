# All this just so Slack sends each link to a new window.
# - Use case: Slack links are one-offs: Open, view, close.
#   (At least that's the Author's typical M.O.)
# - I don't appreciate the default behavior: Raising the last-used browser
#   window and opening a new tab, because then after closing the new tab,
#   I'll have to minimize the raised window.
#   - Also, I group tabs by window, so it's very unlikely that whatever I
#     opened from Slack will be related to the other tabs in whatever
#     window Chrome chooses to raise.
# - Note this hook applies system-wide, unlike macOS Finicky
#     https://github.com/johnste/finicky
#   which lets you filter by calling application.
#   - But I cannot deduce caller here: $0 is bash (obviously),
#     and $PPID is PID 1 (systemd), not very helpful.
#     - E.g., call this below:
#         ~/.depoxy/ambers/bin/notify "$(ps -q $PPID)"
#     - Is there any other way a Desktop Entry can figure out
#       what calls it? Not AFAICT.
