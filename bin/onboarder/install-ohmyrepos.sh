# *** (oh)myrepos paths

# We tell OMR where to find its dependencies, because we install OMR to a
# non-standard path, ~/.kit/git/ohmyrepos, and not the default ~/.ohmyrepos.
# (An infuser eventually makes a ~/.ohmyrepos symlink, but this script runs
#  before then, and this script avoids doing (duplicating) any work mrconfig
#  tasks perform (such as making said symlink). Further, OMR runs in a POSIX
#  shell ($0 = "sh") so it cannot even suss its own path (to find its libs).)

# But first, declare the two parts of the path that are used to build the
# OMR path. These are the default paths that DepoXy uses, but we need the
# path variables to generate the ~/.mrtrust file that `mr` requires.
DOPP_KIT="${DOPP_KIT:-${HOME}/.kit}"

# We don't run ohmyrepos directly, but rather wire it from our mrconfig,
# which uses the OHMYREPOS_LIB environ, e.g., ~/.kit/git/ohmyrepos/lib.
OHMYREPOS_LIB="${OHMYREPOS_LIB:-${GITREPOSPATH}/ohmyrepos/lib}"

# myrepos is good to go as soon as it's on PATH, or if called directly.
# - A `mr infuse` task will eventually symlink it from ~/.local/bin.
# - But for now, from herein, we'll call `mr` directly.

# BUGGY/2024-04-13: I'm skeptical that I really found a bug in Xcode,
# but it seems that way!:
#
# - After `xcode-select --install`, running `m4` brings up familiar
#   popup to request Xcode install, e.g.,:
#
#     The ‚Äúm4‚Äù command requires the command line developer tools.
#     Would you like to install the tools now?
#
#   And on the command line you'll see, e.g.,:
#
#     xcode-select: Failed to locate 'm4', requesting installation of command line developer tools.
#
# - If you run `xcode-select --install`, it reports already installed.
#
# - If you click the popup's <Install> button, it'll happily download and
#   install Xcode again, on top of itself.
#
# - Note that `type -a m4` prints `/usr/bin/m4`, and that file is just a shim.
#   In the author's case (Ventura 14.4.1), there are 76 `/usr/bin/<cmd>` files
#   that share the same inode. They appear to shim to the actual files under
#   the Xcode directory, e.g., at
#
#     /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
#
# - However, the `m4` file is missing!:
#
#     /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/m4  # Missing!
#
# - There is, fortunately, `gm4`, which is the `m4` command.
#
#   - (DUNNO: This may or may not be similar to the Homebrew convention
#      that uses a `g`-prefix to avoid breaking the user's environment.
#      But I don't know if that's the case here, because there are no
#      other `g`-prefixed Xcode commands.)
#
# NLGTN: Assumes if `gm4` exists, to use that (there is no `gm4`
# Aptitude package (Debian), nor any common `gm4` Linux command
# that the author knows).
