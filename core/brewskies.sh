# - BWARE: If you prepend the brew path too soon, it makes some commands
#   run really slowly, including the git-my-merge-status command from
#   another project I publish. I have no idea, and I did not investigate
#   further, I just got lucky reordering this call so that pyenv paths are
#   prepended after brew paths (so that pyenv `python3` is preferred
#   over brew's `python3`, and then I saw that some formerly slow
#   commands were running full tilt again (aka, I got lucky!)).
#   - AFAICT, macOS built-in Bash v3 fairly speedy, but Homebrew Bash v5
#     slow. It seems like Bash v5 is slow *sourcing* files. Which might
#     be a macOS thing, like opening and/or reading files from disk is
#     slow. It also be specific to Apple Silicon/AArch64/arm64/M1 Macs,
#     because I don't remember seeing this issue on older Intel MacBook.
#   - I also tried NixOS Bash, but NixOS Bash also slow. https://nixos.org
